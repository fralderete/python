Return the sum of the numbers in the array, returning 0 for an empty array. 
Except the number 13 is very unlucky, so it does not count and numbers that 
come immediately after a 13 also do not count.

def sum13(nums):
  total = 0     #declare your variables so they can be used in the loop later
  i = 0
  while i < len(nums): #run the loop as long as there are nums in the list
    
    if nums[i] == 13: #check if the number at the current index is = to 13
      i += 2          #if the 13 is found skip the 13 and the number after it
      continue        #continue past the 2 numbers
    
    total += nums[i]  #add whatever number isn't 13 to the list 'total'
    i += 1            #check the next number
    
  return total
