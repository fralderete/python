Return the "centered" average of an array of ints, which we'll say is the 

mean average of the values, except ignoring the largest and smallest values 

in the array. If there are multiple copies of the smallest value, ignore just 

one copy, and likewise for the largest value. Use int division to produce the 

final average. You may assume that the array is length 3 or more.

def centered_average(nums):
  
	nums.pop(nums.index(max(nums)))	 #pops off the largest number
					 #in the list by finding its 
					 #location using index() and max()
	nums.pop(nums.index(min(nums)))
	 				 #pops off the smallest number
					 #in the list by finding its 
					 #location using index() and max()
	avg = sum(nums) / len(nums)
  
	return avg
